By developing this project, we will be developing a park and go system that can be used at any parking lot.
The project was developed on the following capacities:
- Manage all Employees in the system - Has the right to Add new employees, remove employees, Update employee
Details and when needed he should be able to retrieve the information of employees. (Search the needed employee and
retrieve information about that employee) In addition a separate report will be handled to store the relevant employee
details. Also, the server role should be able to view his/her profile from the system and should be able to edit his details
when needed. To do the above task he/she should login to the system with their login credentials.
- Manage Parking Slots – This function manages all parking slots in the system (For both Booking system and Ticketing
System). Assigning of the parking space can be done by giving parking space type, parking slot number, car number,
entry date and time. After assigning the relevant space the slot status will be occupied, otherwise it will be an available
space. We can update the parking slot and if we want to release the slot, we can delete it accordingly. Furthermore, we
can get a full detailed report regarding the slots which are available, and which are occupied.
- Manages Salary of all employees. This function manages the salaries of all employees in the system. This would
include details of employee’s salaries, bonuses, deductions, net pay, and other factors. This can monitor absences,
leaves, hours worked, overtime and calculate the amount an employee should be paid for the pay period. This will also
generate a salary statement report.
- Manage Customer booking - Manage bookings of the customer. The booking is done by getting customer name
(registered), contact number, vehicle model, number plate details, payment amount, date from, date to and other details.
The system (parking slot management system) will assign a slot for the customer according to the availability of slots.
The customer can update the dates that they have booked and delete the booking if they want. Once the customer logs
into his/her account they can view their booking details. The regular customers can obtain promotions and special
seasonal offers as well. This function also allocates a bus to the customer to reach his/her destination and this fee will be
included to the booking fee as well.
- Manage the Registered Customers in the system. Customers are advised to register with the system especially if they
plan to use the services regularly. For the customer to make the monthly payment for the parking space, he/she should
login to the system with the credentials he/she provided when registering. The details provided at registration and the
arrival and departure times can be view once the customer logs into his/her account.
- Manage the ticketing system in the company. This function is related only for walk-in customers. The tickets are
issued only for the customers who are not registered with the system (walk-in customers) The walk-in customer should
buy a ticket and the price will be calculated to the duration time the customer spent again to take his/her own vehicle
from the parking slot. When entering the vehicle, system will give a specific time to take his/her vehicle. If the customer
needs to extend the given time by the system, he/she should inform the system admin otherwise an additional amount
will be charged from the customer. Once the walk-in customer leaves the parking lot with his/her vehicle, the system
can delete his/her record.
- Manage the transportation of customers. For this we use private buses. Once the customer parks the vehicle in the
parking lot, he/she can use a private bus to reach the destination from there. Here there is a separate driver and a
conductor for each bus. Transportation management includes keeping track of bus drivers, conductors and details of the
busses. This also includes managing all available routes for the relevant buses. Any Customer can also view the route
details through the web application.

By the assortment of all the above capacities, this system provides user friendliness, simple and attractive
interfaces that user can easily understand as well as effective report generation.
